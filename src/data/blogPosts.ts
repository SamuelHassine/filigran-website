The world of breach and attack simulation has changed. Security teams no longer want isolated tests; they want continuous visibility, actionable insights, and validation that reflects how modern attackers actually operate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adversarial Exposure Validation (AEV)</strong> represents that evolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It connects the dots between threat intelligence, exposures, and validation to answer a single, crucial question: <em>what can actually hurt us, and how do we stop it?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenAEV is built to help teams continuously assess, prioritize, and improve their defenses. And it allows defenses to be tested from all angles &#8211; tools, processes and people. <em><strong>Its industry’s first open-source, threat-informed end-to-end AEV solution.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenAEV is tightly integrated with OpenCTI: OpenCTI surfaces threats and exposures; OpenAEV makes them actionable. The bi-directional connection lets you build intel-driven, prioritized scenarios in OpenCTI and launch them in OpenAEV, closing the loop from insight to validation to improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"742\" src=\"https://filigran.io/app/uploads/2024/04/openaev-ecosystem_102025-light.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5828\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Connecting Technology, People, and Processes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Security validation isn’t only about technology. It’s about people: their decisions, reactions, and coordination under pressure. OpenAEV supports this human readiness through built-in <a href=\"/how-to-run-a-successful-cybersecurity-tabletop-exercise/\">tabletop exercises</a> so teams can simulate both attack scenarios and end-to-end crisis response. This is essential for validating and stress-testing your incident response plan. Ditch the manual checklists and Excel sheets: OpenAEV standardizes, automates, and scales tabletop programs globally.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"tac_iframe\" data-content=\"\n&lt;div style=&quot;background: radial-gradient(80.02% 39.33% at 51.52% 88.18%, rgba(15, 188, 255, .1) 0%, rgba(15, 188, 255, 0) 100%), linear-gradient(321deg, #021525 10.12%, rgba(40, 52, 79, 0) 98.26%); border-radius:10px; border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);margin: var(--spacing-xl) 0px; padding: var(--spacing-xl); position: relative; overflow: hidden;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;strong&gt;Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA)&lt;/strong&gt; went on a lookout for a crisis management tool to conduct situational awareness and table-top exercises, they turned to Filigran.

It helps teams identify gaps in their plans and strengthen overall resilience against evolving threats. You can see tabletop exercises as fire drills, it happens regularly each quarter or each month in some cases. It’s necessary and helps build muscle memories by making people aware of their role and responsibilities when a cyberattack hits the business. Various regulations like HIPAA, NIST, NIS2, DORA and PCI DSS demand tabletop exercises to test incident response plans. It is often discussion-based with minimum technical involvement, done in a low-pressure environment and focused on team collaboration. Many tabletop exercises today rely on manual work or excel sheets. And all these lead to a major drawback of traditional tabletop exercises: hard to scale due to high cost of time and resources.

It could incorporate various cyber threat vectors including ransomware, insider threats, phishing or be specific to a sector. Each organization has its own unique current state of exposure and this planning stage is crucial to ensure that the most exploitable attack paths or processes are validated.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Engaging phase</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Simulate the planned scenario and have all participants actively engaging in the discussion and contributing solutions. Interactivity is the key, just like how everyone should be involved during a real attack.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Take decisions. The IT team controls the damage, legal team preserve evidence and assess regulatory consequences, PR team prepare public statement, marketing team prepares customer communications and so on.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Capture issues and document timelines as the scenario goes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learning phase</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Debrief and feedback. Review the results of the exercise with metrics. With OpenAEV, we help organizations assess their readiness from three aspects: prevention, detection and vulnerability on a 100% scale. Tangible metrics allow teams to better answer the question: what did we do well and where can we improve?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Recommendations and follow-up plans.

You can easily set up a tabletop exercise from scratch on OpenAEV (here is our <a href=\"/build-your-table-top-scenario-with-openbas/#h-Preparing-your-scenario-with-OpenBAS\">step-to-step guide</a>).

And this is exactly what organizations need to achieve with regular, effective tabletop exercises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automate your tabletop exercises so you can continuously test your team in various scenarios. Keep these drills in micro-dose size so your team can continuously get their memory renewed with most relevant and up-to-date best practices on current attack scenarios. Identify and respond to today’s problem with the latest process that has been tested and practiced instead of what’s written on the incident response plan last quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also good to keep in mind that perfection is not the goal but communication is in these tabletop exercises. These cyber crisis scenarios help your team to identify areas of improvements, security gaps and prepare them better when facing pressure.

    "content": "\n<p><strong>Security validation</strong> is experiencing its most exciting transformation in years, as organizations embrace a more strategic and proactive approach to understanding their true security posture. With numerous diverse tools in any typical security stack, its only reasonable that due focus is given to validate the effectiveness of these tools. This transformation is driven by two game-changing capabilities that CISOs and security leaders have long sought and is now coming together: <strong>unified exposure management</strong> that provides visibility and context across complex hybrid infrastructures, and <strong>continuous security validation</strong> that delivers real-time confidence in defensive capabilities.<br>This transformation is shaping up a new solution space &#8211; <strong>Adversarial Exposure Validation (AEV)</strong>. Read on if you would like to:</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Understand the convergence towards exposure management and role AEV plays in it</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Know what to look out for in an AEV solution</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Go beyond security tools validation, test your human readiness also</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-turning-exposure-into-action\">Turning Exposure into Action</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Amid expanding attack surfaces and a surge of vulnerabilities, organizations are looking for clear visibility into <strong>which exposures are truly exploitable</strong>. Vulnerability management alone is no longer sufficient and we need to go beyond CVEs to risk-based exposure management &#8211; to identify most probable threats, attack paths, and exploitable configurations. A proactive approach to find, prioritize, and eliminate the conditions that let attacks succeed, based on an individual organization exposures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A unified and continuous exposure management approach empowers CISOs to address these areas:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Cutting through the noise:</strong> What are the truly exploitable vulnerabilities and most probably attack paths that we need to emulate in our environment?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reality check:</strong> Are our security investments actually stopping attacks, or are we flying blind with tools that look good on dashboards but fail when tested?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The 3 AM test:</strong> When crisis hits, will my team respond with confidence built from practice, or chaos from inexperience?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Gartner, organizations can reduce frequency and impact of cyberattacks by 50%, by enriching SOC data with exposure information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-rise-of-adversarial-exposure-validation-bas-2-0\"><strong>Rise of Adversarial Exposure Validation: <em>BAS 2.0</em>?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Adversarial Exposure Validation (AEV) is emerging as a crucial component of exposure management, to create a context-aware validation ecosystem that finally answers the question: <em><strong>what can actually hurt us and how do we stop it?</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/6255151\">Gartner</a> defines AEV as ‘<em>technologies that deliver consistent, continuous, and automated evidence of the feasibility of an attack</em>.’Its about proactively assessing adversary’s TTPs and most probable attack paths in a continuous loop. Emphasis here is on <strong>continuous validation and security optimization</strong> and in that sense it goes beyond traditional Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS). We don’t see AEV as a replacement of BAS rather as evolution of BAS itself. With an AEV platform, you can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Validate your defenses by emulating attacker behavior;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Continuously find and prioritizes the conditions that would let an attacker succeed;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>And finally, get remediation guidance to fix the gaps.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In short, BAS to AEV evolution is from ‘<em>can we detect it?’</em> to ‘<em>let’s eliminate it</em>.’</strong></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"tac_iframe\" data-content=\"\n&lt;table style=&quot;margin-top:8px;width:100%;

Its usage depends on your initial case case and scope based on your critical assets, business process and incident response plan. However, at the bare minimum, an AEV tool should provide you the following options:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Wide coverage</strong>: ability to emulate a wide variety of attacks across the entire cyber kill chain by using industry standard frameworks like MITRE ATT&amp;CK, NIST, Caldera etc</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Prioritization</strong>: capability to prioritize threats and vulnerabilities to map the most probable attack paths</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Flexible scenarios</strong>: customizable scenarios and payloads, pre-packaged scenarios library</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Automated workflows</strong>: no-code AI-assisted scenario creation and automated workflows to scale your red team capability and ease of use for non-technical use cases like tabletop exercises</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Recurring scenarios</strong> to show posture improve overtime and to be able to track Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Remediation</strong> <strong>guidance</strong>: assess how well your detection rules are working and remediation guidance on vulnerability patching with multiple options</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-are-we-evolving-our-aev-capabilities\">How are we evolving our AEV capabilities?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Filigran’s inception in 2022, our eXtended Threat Management (XTM) suite has been evolving with a clear vision towards <strong>threat-informed defense.</strong> In this context, our product strategy has already been industry leading. Our first offering as part of the XTM suite was OpenCTI, to <strong>operationalize threat intelligence</strong> with end-to-end threat lifecycle management capabilities. Then came OpenBAS Community Edition (CE) with simulation and security validation capabilities, which made OpenCTI’s intel output truly actionable. And now we have added enterprise grade features to it including automated workflows, AI-assisted scenario creation &amp; remediation guidance, ability to run simulations with customer specific EDR agents. To acknowledge this evolution from pure control validation to full adversarial exposure management, its only appropriate that we refer to our new (still open-source) AEV platform as OpenAEV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While OpenCTI provides <strong>threat</strong> and <strong>exposure assessment</strong> capabilities, OpenAEV makes it directly actionable to <strong>validate</strong> and <strong>improve</strong> security posture. Benefitting from bi-directional integration between OpenCTI and OpenAEV, customers can build scenarios based on <strong>prioritized threat intelligence</strong> from within OpenCTI itself, and execute them directly in OpenAEV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The continuous exposure discovery, attack‑path mapping, prioritization, and remediation guidance provides some of the <strong>broadest exposure management capabilities</strong> available on the market today.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://filigran.io/app/uploads/2025/10/graphic-for-openaev_1025-dark-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5729\" srcset=\"https://filigran.io/app/uploads/2025/10/graphic-for-openaev_1025-dark-1024x576.png 1024w, https://filigran.io/app/uploads/2025/10/graphic-for-openaev_1025-dark-300x169.png 300w, https://filigran.io/app/uploads/2025/10/graphic-for-openaev_1025-dark-768x432.png 768w, https://filigran.io/app/uploads/2025/10/graphic-for-openaev_1025-dark-1536x864.png 1536w, https://filigran.io/app/uploads/2025/10/graphic-for-openaev_1025-dark.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">OpenAEV Ecosystem</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">OpenAEV as AEV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With OpenAEV, you can optimize not just your security stack, but your security processes and incident response plans too. Traditional tabletop or crisis management exercises are run like fire drills &#8211; necessary, but hardly sufficient. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge has always been scale. But with OpenAEV, you standardize, automate and scale tabletop exercises. By integrating human readiness testing into our OpenAEV platform, we&#8217;re also addressing CTEM&#8217;s mobilization challenge at scale. Every validation cycle becomes an opportunity to test not just if you can detect a threat, but whether your team can effectively respond to it. Can they mobilize the right resources? Make the right decisions? Communicate effectively with stakeholders?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"981\" src=\"https://filigran.io/app/uploads/2025/10/hacker-news_aev_diagram.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5730\" srcset=\"https://filigran.io/app/uploads/2025/10/hacker-news_aev_diagram.png 1920w, https://filigran.io/app/uploads/2025/10/hacker-news_aev_diagram-300x153.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use Cases Supported by OpenAEV</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Scale blue team capabilities</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Improve exposure awareness</strong>: leverage OpenCTI to automatically build scenarios by utilizing Prioritized Threat Intelligence (PIR)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Optimize defenses</strong>: Validate security platform with realistic scenrios and improve security posture through guided remediation</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>Scale red team capabilities</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Offensive testing</strong>: Run deep simulations to understand particular threat actors’ or campaigns’ attack paths and movements</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Scale purple team capabilities</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Continuous improvement and risk reduction</strong>: Centralize purple team’s exercises with both red &amp; blue team to implement a continuous posture improvement plan with timelines.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <strong>Standardize crisis management</strong>:  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Globally scale tabletop exercises with a dynamic, ease-to-use platform instead of doing manual preparations and using Excel files.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://filigran.io/app/uploads/2025/10/bas-to-aev_use-cases-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5731\" srcset=\"https://filigran.io/app/uploads/2025/10/bas-to-aev_use-cases-1024x576.png 1024w, https://filigran.io/app/uploads/2025/10/bas-to-aev_use-cases-300x169.png 300w, https://filigran.io/app/uploads/2025/10/bas-to-aev_use-cases-768x432.png 768w, https://filigran.io/app/uploads/2025/10/bas-to-aev_use-cases-1536x864.png 1536w, https://filigran.io/app/uploads/2025/10/bas-to-aev_use-cases.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">OpenAEV Use cases</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The progression from BAS to AEV to human-integrated validation represents the maturation of security testing.

The “chain of steps” approach can also be applied to the problem at hand, but might be a long and cumbersome work of expliciting all the different combinations, takin into account both graphQL grammar and OpenCTI specific implementation. Given the latest results, it felt natural to look to the side of agentic paradigm, turning the problem upside down. Instead of describing atomic tasks and order them into a rigid workflow, we decided to try and describe all the different capabilities needed to perform the task and feed them to an “agent”, that would autonomously select and use the relevant tool at a given step of its process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-building-the-foundation-model-context-protocol-mcp\">Building the foundation: Model Context Protocol (MCP)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To start with, there is a need to describe those tools into a standard a common framework, to make sure they can be used by any agentic implementation. The leading standard at the time of writing is <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro\">Model Context Protocol</a> (MCP) with a wide variety of open sources servers, some dealing with the problem at hand. However, we quickly figured out there was not an out-of-the-box solution to be used, and we decided to implement our own with Filigran’s open source DNA : you can have a look <a href=\"https://github.com/FiligranHQ/xtm-mcp\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see in the source code, we come up with tools to understand a given graphQL schema, generate a query that is working, and execute it in an OpenCTI environment. Next step is then to connect an agent with those tools, and hope for magic to happen. But as Uncle Vernon once said “there is no such thing as magic”, and such a naive implementation proved to be under performing both in terms of processing time (answer generation was long) and relevance (answer ware not always on point, especially for irrelevant questions). In order to have a finer control over the query generation, we understood that we could use agents, but into a more granular flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-granular-flow\">A Granular Flow</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To address the challenges described earlier, we have implemented a logical AI workflow that guides the agent step-by-step in answering user questions. This granular approach breaks down the process as follows:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"tac_iframe\" data-content=\"\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;script async src=&quot;https://js.storylane.io/js/v2/storylane.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&quot;sl-embed&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;padding-bottom:calc(49.22% + 25px);width:100%;height:0;transform:scale(1)&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;iframe loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;sl-demo&quot; src=&quot;https://app.storylane.io/demo/7sebfnktiblm?embed=inline&quot; name=&quot;sl-embed&quot; allow=&quot;fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%!important;height:100%!important;border:1px solid rgba(63,95,172,0.35);box-shadow: 0px 0px 18px rgba(26, 19, 72, 0.15);border-radius:10px;box-sizing:border-box;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\">\n<div>\n  <script async src=\"https://js.storylane.io/js/v2/storylane.js\"></script>\n  <div class=\"sl-embed\" style=\"position:relative;padding-bottom:calc(49.22% + 25px);width:100%;height:0;transform:scale(1)\">\n    <iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"sl-demo\" src=\"https://app.storylane.io/demo/7sebfnktiblm?embed=inline\" name=\"sl-embed\" allow=\"fullscreen\" allowfullscreen style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%!important;height:100%!important;border:1px solid rgba(63,95,172,0.35);box-shadow: 0px 0px 18px rgba(26, 19, 72, 0.15);border-radius:10px;box-sizing:border-box;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-process-the-question\">1: Process the question</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Determine whether the question is relevant</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Identify if any entities are explicitly named, and verify their presence in the data</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Classify the type of entity involved (e.g., malware, attack pattern)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-build-and-execute-the-query\">2: Build and execute the query</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Select the relevant entity types based on the question (such as malware or vulnerability)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Retrieve field definitions, filters, and sorting options using <a href=\"https://github.com/FiligranHQ/xtm-mcp\">MCP tools</a> to construct the query.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Execute the query</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-interpret-the-results-and-write-an-answer\">3: Interpret the results and write an answer</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of these steps is orchestrated by <strong>ArianeAi</strong>, ensuring the question flows logically from interpretation to execution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following chart provides a visual overview of how the agent constructs answers through this multi-step process.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1776\" height=\"3234\" src=\"https://filigran.io/app/uploads/2025/10/blog_opencti-chatbot-execution-flow_1025.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5712\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">OpenCTI chatbot execution flow</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-granularity-matters\">Why granularity matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This modular flow offers significant flexibility. It enables combining AI components (agents, MCP tools) with customized logic like authentication, rate limiting, and URL generation tailored to the OpenCTI chatbot’s needs. Moreover, depending on the complexity of each step, different model sizes can be employed—smaller, faster LLMs for more routine tasks, and larger, more powerful models for complex interpretation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to our internal benchmarks, this approach delivers better and faster results compared to relying on a single agent attempting to directly use the appropriate MCP tool(s). By decomposing the problem, each step can be optimized independently, improving efficiency and accuracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-where-we-stand-and-what-s-next\">Where we stand, and what’s next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This first iteration is only the beginning, and we are just scratching the surface of what Agentic AI can achieve within Filigran’s XTM suite. For now, the chatbot operates using OpenAI’s gpt-4.1-mini, but our goal is to run it on our own infrastructure. Early experiments with open-weight models like <code>Qwen3</code> and <code>gpt-oss</code> have shown encouraging results.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-current-limitations\">Current limitations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Large language models, however, come with inherent limitations. For example, they do not count well. A well-known example is that many models (even big ones) fail to answer simple questions like “how many Rs are there in Strawberry?”. Hence, OpenCTI’s chatbot struggles to count elements in very long lists and will not do well at questions such as “what are the top 5 targeted countries?”, “what is the most active threat actor?”. Not to mention limitations due to the LLMs context window. We have identified ways to tackle this issue and will implement them in upcoming iterations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The underlying data structure in OpenCTI adds another layer of complexity, with numerous entity types and fields potentially relevant to each user query. Sometimes, it is hard for the model to determine exactly what needs to be queried and how to interpret returned results for nuanced questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-future-capabilities\">Future capabilities</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the chatbot is limited to reading data; it cannot create, modify, or delete information. Before expanding these capabilities, our priority with <strong>ArianeAi</strong> is to ensure the model consistently interprets and answers questions correctly. In upcoming releases, there will be the possibility to create reports with the chatbot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrating <a href=\"/agentic-ai/\">Agentic AI</a> into OpenCTI marks a significant step toward making cyber threat intelligence more accessible and actionable. By leveraging a granular agentic workflow, we’ve enabled natural language queries to be translated into precise GraphQL queries, delivering human-readable insights in a chatbot right into the OpenCTI application, 24/7. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The adoption of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and custom tools has enhanced the chatbot’s ability to navigate OpenCTI’s complex data structure, despite challenges like LLM limitations in counting or handling nuanced queries. While the current iteration, powered by gpt-4.1-mini, excels at reading and interpreting data, future releases, such as OpenCTI 6.9, will introduce capabilities like report creation. Ongoing experiments with open-weight models like Qwen3 and gpt-oss signal a move toward self-hosted infrastructure, promising greater scalability and flexibility. This is just the beginning, as we continue to refine and expand the chatbot’s potential within Filigran’s XTM suite. Come and give it a try, we’d be thrilled to hear your feedbacks!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enjoy and feel free to ask any questions about it on our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://filigran-community.slack.com/\">Slack community channe</a><a href=\"https://community.filigran.io/\">l</a>&nbsp;!</p>\n",
